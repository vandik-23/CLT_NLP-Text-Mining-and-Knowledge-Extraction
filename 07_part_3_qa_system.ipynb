The objective is to condense the content to a form that is more manageable for the T5 model, which will be used to generate questions and answers. To accommodate the limitations of the T5 model, the content is summarized with a maximum token count of 512. This ensures that the summarized content does not exceed the T5 model's processing limit."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5035,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703562239503,"user":{"displayName":"Karsanth Ponnaiya","userId":"15529858246684025042"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"meysj9jm0oel","outputId":"8ef02506-8f1a-4d96-ba90-955bc8ce54e3"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install bert-extractive-summarizer\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000,"referenced_widgets":["244ff30402254806b9eae9099566c226","299f953916424b46afbc3bb21ee5ebdd","69fcce63ae4249d59cadd9764a633ff1","b2453c1769bb44bea9e515cec43c89e2","09ba2ce8db224da893d22cabbde12cf1","0d03c5338d5640e081ce248ffedc27bb","c0f168ff1c65416f93d21a083e471724","8a0609f1bcc14d4f8c7017179e184d2b","431755837ef847a480960602cf3c04e7","7d6ce944b2054f509d56266783eeacf6","65f85beffe124d928fda902c9332a1f4","94ff99b547b24747b20f4ea7e875a6d6","d4a95c19205248d892ee833cb6ca0860","771a0a8cb0e74840b1c94cb4e74096f2","7236960e13c447e69a949c408eb889ad","cbd542894621440ba346673d2090be24","50bf8771ff6c4dbb94c306364bd0c0cd","d745dfb2fb4d471d8e8838943a38ffb9","524cb9845fda47f4a0dcf7fbcf01eee7","bf4da5eba3db459a89a52188c568de08","c95915a1988246898e49ab8df616710a","dad7cd0440fa4906ad1aab35501c46e2","66dd648880b6433c9573f69d615a1aa6","ad9db48e44e0436498e6167883ab2844","23842f2d390c43d89a2628557d80462d","76d09530b5a0482dae8db7ba06c252e4","c64cf4ed995848ebac7f14cd35380c41","592c36907f64488cb4602f4411d0b5e1","58d2e9f4aec340e892e02275d0020610","0eb86a615d0645989b18b66d11bf7483","f2c6bf8ca4864ad48d0387366c13d5e2","996704fd9056474388dc94783ca87a64","20bf5202ea9e4e8caf4a6af0bf08ad53","b98babaa9ac94662958c0c9231a9b2f6","ca8d64bb33bb4c2ca0a0b1add5361ce9","5835c7d7e1c24a57a8399aa019179f91","44b391eb15424b62a161a4a5517f58de","c9b66fec29dc430997747d6b1e3a603a","da8ff05c130646099581bb925b4add94","51f7b9442359493183a80d136a5406af","320d728fc50845e899b9102352a22418","e23156e8139d459e8e2e8dee20580a7a","3c265d98bbe449e9b731c5c4aac48640","4ee9576cc0ab42d79097a6e04521816b","8d888ef4ec7d467394d67ae3841cce4f","8afa9db9e8344ef4a92c513f5344bc2c","dab89d337114483693e4f02392588950","e560a27d517745f8b4cdffa3aa352fbf","4f4be6b289f34a67a2a2d6951df6096d","647ea8708be94104952d262fa9cf5316","73f184361a0a405296b1716b042f813a","1a97982f995b475398db1f3cb114c0fc","a225d1e0fccc4c27bd165365fe18490f","beb98952a3f8447992ddb704f0c68a34","6a61a0975fcc4cd1b1318700ff1789e6"]},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4478692,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703566718191,"user":{"displayName":"Karsanth Ponnaiya","userId":"15529858246684025042"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"xFqs-lH_0Nyd","outputId":"68cdb1e2-e4b8-4e46-9aad-d064134a84f3"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"244ff30402254806b9eae9099566c226","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/571 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"94ff99b547b24747b20f4ea7e875a6d6","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["model.safetensors:   0%|          | 0.00/1.34G [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"66dd648880b6433c9573f69d615a1aa6","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["tokenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/28.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"b98babaa9ac94662958c0c9231a9b2f6","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["vocab.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/232k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"8d888ef4ec7d467394d67ae3841cce4f","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/466k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[1;30;43mDie letzten 5000 Zeilen der Streamingausgabe wurden abgeschnitten.\u001b[0m\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:870: FutureWarning: The default value of `n_init` will change from 10 to 'auto' in 1.4.
