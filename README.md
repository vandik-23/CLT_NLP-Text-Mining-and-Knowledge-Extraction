![WorldCloud](https://github.com/vandik-23/CLT_NLP-Text-Mining-and-Knowledge-Extraction/blob/main/Word_cloud.png)

## Description:
In the context of our project, analyzing specialized media publications on cleantech topics.
In this project, we start with an exploratory text analysis including topic modeling to understand the cleantech media data. We then train word and sentence embedding models to better represent the content of cleantech innovations and develop a question answering / information retrieval system.

## Dataset:
The Cleantech Media Dataset contains ca. 10k specialized articles and other documents on cleantech, published in authoritative online sources in the timespan 2021-2023. 
The dataset is available for download from Kaggle: [Cleantech Media Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jannalipenkova/cleantech-media-dataset)

## Organizers:
As a joint task of industry and academia for the HSLU Applied Information and Data Science Masterâ€™s program in the course Computational Language Technologies.

## Pipeline:

#### Stage 1: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis including topic modelling
 - Data Collection and Cleaning
 - Text Preprocessing
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Topic Modeling

#### Stage 2: Training word and sentence embedding models
 - Data Preparation for Embeddings
 - Word Embedding Training
 - Sentence Embedding Training
 - Embedding Model Evaluation
 - Transfer Learning with Open Source Models

#### Stage 3: : Question answering
 - Question answering (QA) system
